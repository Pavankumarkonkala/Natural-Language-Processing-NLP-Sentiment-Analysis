# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
Conducted an NLP project to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews for a leading product. The goal was to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, and identify common themes in customer feedback. Utilized tokenization and stemming for text preprocessing, and employed sentiment lexicons to gauge sentiment polarity. Visualized sentiment trends over time using line charts and created word clouds to highlight frequently mentioned terms. Achieved an accuracy of 92% in sentiment classification and provided insights on improving product aspects based on customer sentiment.
